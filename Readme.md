# Personal AI Operating System

It's a fun learning project to learn about LangChain, LangGraph and MCP Servers. And Enhance my skill/proficiency in python.

## Technologies used:

1. **MCP Server:** it create a standard way for the models to interact with servers that hold real-world data or perform useful tasks.
2. **Playwright:** Browser automation engine( it's used as an MCP tool).
3. **LangChain:** it's used for giving access tools to ai agents. basically, it answers: "How do I let an LLM call tools?”
4. **LangGraph:** it let u decide node and edges like a flowchart, Each node can represent a task, an action or a model call. This structure allows loops, branching, and parallel paths. It’s perfect for building agent-like systems where the model reasons, decides, and acts.
5. **Python:**

### LangChain Tools

- MCP SERVER (FASTMCP): Create an interface for the ai brain, like call function or something
- Playwright:
- OS
- APIs

### Who Can Contribute:

**Required Knowledge**

- Basic to intermediate Python

- Understanding of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

- Familiarity with Git & GitHub (clone, branch, commit, pull requests)

- Recommended Before Contributing

- Read the reference articles listed below

**Basic understanding of:**

- LangChain tool-calling concepts

- LangGraph workflow graphs

- MCP (Model Context Protocol) idea

**Good to Have**

- Experience with browser automation (Playwright or Selenium)
- Familiarity with APIs and async programming
- Interest in AI agent systems

**Contribution Expectations**

- Write clean, readable code
- Add brief comments where logic is non-obvious
- Test changes before submitting a PR
- Keep commits descriptive
